# About
This script utilizes the inotify library to collect a series of outputs into a single status line and writes it to a fifo.

# Usage
Place scripts into the `scripts` directory and run `status.sh`
At the moment the scripts must write to a relative "outputs" directory. The name of their output file determines the order they will appear in the status line (e.g. `00-xyzzy` will come before `20-battery`).
To stop the script send a SIGINT or SIGTERM (e.g. Ctrl+c or kill).

Although built for usage with dvtm, this should also work with dzen.

# Requirements
All this script relies on is inotify and the inotify tool "inotifywait".
