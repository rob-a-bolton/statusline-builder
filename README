# About
This script runs a collection of other scripts and prints their collective last line of output.

# Usage
Place scripts into ~/stldbr.d (or specify a directory with the -s option).
You may also place text files in this directory and they will be printed with newlines replaced by spaces.
Scripts and text files are differentiated based on whether they have +x permissions, so do not make your text files executable.
You will probably want to redirect this into a FIFO for e.g. dvtm, dzen

To stop the script send a SIGINT or SIGTERM (e.g. Ctrl+c or kill).

# Requirements
Python 3
